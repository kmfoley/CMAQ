# 4. Model Input Files

This chapter provides basic information on the format and content of CMAQ input files.  It also provides information on using the pre-processing tools provided in the repository for preparing inital and boundary conditions and meteorology inputs. A list of CMAQ input files can be found in [Table 4-1](#Input_Table). Some CMAQ input files are in ASCII format while the majority of them are in the [Network Common Data Form (netCDF)] format (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). CMAQ input and output files are self-describing netCDF-format files in which the file headers have all the dimensioning and descriptive information needed to define the resident data. Users should download the latest code for the NetCDF from the [NetCDF website](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). Compilation and configuration information for the NetCDF is available through the Unidata website.

All CMAQ input and output files are conformed to I/O API netCDF file format. Please refer to the [I/O API User's Manual](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/documentation/all_versions/html) for details.


## 4.1 CMAQ Pre-processors 
### 4.1.1 Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP)

**>>COMMENT<<** MCIP is technically in M3 I/O API, not netCDF.

**>>COMMENT<<** Should SMOKE have its own section?

As discussed previously in [Chapter 2](CMAQ_UG_ch02_program_structure.md), MCIP processes meteorological model output from the WRF model into I/O API-formatted files that are compatible with CMAQ and SMOKE (the emissions processor that computes emissions inputs to CMAQ). MCIP automatically determines whether an input file is generated by WRF‑ARW by trying to open the file as a netCDF file. If the file can be read as netCDF, MCIP assumes the input is a WRF‑ARW dataset. MCIP can be used to uniformly trim cells off the lateral boundary of the domain defined by the meteorological model, or to window in on a subset of that domain (window just mean to select a specific spatial portion of the domain). Configuration options for MCIP include the time periods over which to extract data from the meteorological model output files, horizontal and vertical grid definitions, and selections for integrating satellite cloud observations into MCIP output.

Many of the fields that are simulated by the meteorological model are not modified by MCIP for the emissions model and CMAQ, and they are written to I/O API files. Fields that are required for the transformation to CMAQ’s generalized coordinate system are calculated within MCIP. The dry deposition velocities are no longer calculated by MCIP. CMAQv5 calculates all dry and wet deposition velocities, MCIPv3.4 is the last version of MCIP that calculates those velocities internally.

MCIP can extract both temporal and spatial subsets of the input meteorology files. The run script allows the user to specify the beginning and end dates/times of the MCIP simulation; these dates/times can fall anywhere within the range of the input meteorological time period, but must be consistent with the time granularity of the meteorological files. MCIP cannot perform temporal interpolations to artificially increase the temporal resolution of the meteorology fields. Two types of horizontal domain windowing are allowed with MCIP. The boundary trim option (“BTRIM”) uniformly trims grid cells off each of the four lateral boundaries of the input meteorology grid. The nonuniform trim option specifies an offset from the lower left corner of the input meteorology domain and the number of cells in the X and Y directions from the revised origin to extract from the input domain. More information about how to invoke these options is provided in the next section: [MCIP](#Execution Configuration Variables). MCIP also provides the capability to reconfigure the vertical layer structure in the input meteorology through interpolation from the input structure to an output structure defined through sigma coordinates in the run script. Commonly referred to as “layer collapsing,” this option should be exercised with caution as it can significantly impact the conservation of energy assumption inherent in the meteorology through its effects on the predicted wind fields.

The output files generated by MCIP are part of the input files for ICON and BCON and various other programs in CMAQ, requiring it to be the first program that needs to be compiled after installing the CMAQ source codes and initializing CMAQ environment variables on your system. Unlike many of the programs in the CMAQ program suite MCIP is compiled with a Makefile and then run with a run script. Instructions on how to compile and run MCIP are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/mcip/README.md) file in the PREP/mcip folder.

### 4.1.2 Initial Conditions Processor (ICON)

ICON generates a gridded netCDF file of the chemical conditions for all grid cells in the modeling domain for the initial time of a simulation. It can generate these initial conditions from either an existing CCTM output file or an ASCII file of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ. Running ICON requires that the user already generated MCIP files for their target modeling domain. For both input file options, ICON will interpolate the data to the horizontal and vertical structure of the target domain as defined in the MCIP files. The species in the ICON output file are identical to those in the input (either CCTM output or ASCII profile) file.

Using an existing CCTM output file to generate initial conditions is applicable when extrapolating initial conditions from a coarse to a fine grid simulation, as may occur when setting up nested simulations (simulations with finer-resolution grids that cover part of coarser-resolution grids). This is the preferred mode of specifying initial conditions since the spatial concentration patterns derived from the coarser-resolution simulation can be considered a first approximation of the concentration fields over the finer-resolution subdomain at the beginning of the simulation.

The ASCII file of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ represents annual average concentrations at a grid cell over the Pacific derived from a simulation with the hemispheric version of CMAQv5.3 beta2 for the year 2016. As such, these concentration profiles are reflective of conditions in a remote marine environment. If this ASCII profile file is used to generate initial conditions, the resulting concentration fields will be uniform over the modeling domain and will not be a realistic representation of conditions over the modeling domain. As a result, simulations initialized with profile-derived rather than CCTM-derived concentration fields may require longer spin-up periods before conditions simulated within the domain no longer are influenced by these unrealistic initial concentration fields.  


The configuration options for ICON include choosing whether the initial conditions are generated from an existing CCTM output file or from an ASCII profile, and defining the horizontal and vertical grids and time for which initial conditions are to be generated. Information on configuring ICON for the different kinds of input data, environment variables, input and output files, compiling and running ICON are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/icon/README.md) file in the PREP/icon folder.

### 4.1.3 Boundary Conditions Processor (BCON)

BCON generates a netCDF file of the chemical conditions along the lateral boundaries of the modeling domain. BCON will generate an output file with chemical concentrations for all grid cells along the modeling domain's horizontal boundaries. It can generate these boundary conditions from either an existing CCTM output file or an ASCII file of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ. Running BCON requires that the user already generated MCIP files for their target modeling domain. For both input file options, BCON will interpolate the data to the horizontal and vertical structure of the target domain as defined in the MCIP files. The species in the BCON output file are identical to those in the input (either CCTM output or ASCII profile) file. Depending on user specified options and/or input datasets, the boundary conditions generated by BCON can be time varying, time independent, and either spatially uniform or variable across the model boundaries.

Using an existing CCTM output file to generate boundary conditions is applicable when setting up windowed simulations (simulations with the same resolution that cover only a part of the outer domain) or nested simulations (simulations with finer-resolution grids that cover part of coarser-resolution grids). This is the preferred mode of specifying boundary conditions since the spatial concentration patterns derived from the coarser-resolution simulation will be spatially varying along the boundaries of the finer-resolution domain. Boundary conditions generated from CCTM output files will be either time varying or time independent.

The ASCII file of vertically resolved concentration profiles distributed with CMAQ represents annual average concentrations at a grid cell over the Pacific derived from a simulation with the hemispheric version of CMAQv5.3 beta2 for the year 2016. As such, these concentration profiles are reflective of conditions in a remote marine environment. If this ASCII profile file is used to generate boundary conditions, the resulting concentration fields will be uniform along the boundaries of the modeling domain and will not vary in time. Therefore, they are not a realistic representation of conditions along the domain boundaries and should only be used in cases where boundary conditions are not expected to affect the interpretation of model results. 

CMAQ can use boundary conditions derived from global chemistry models (GCMs). While BCON does not directly support processing of datasets from GCMs (other than the hemispheric version of CMAQ) in their native formats, users could develop their own custom codes to transform their GCM datasets into I/O API format, which would then allow these datasets to be input into BCON in the same way as an existing CCTM output file. 

The configuration options for BCON include choosing whether the boundary conditions are generated from an existing CCTM output file or from an ASCII profile, and defining the horizontal and vertical grids and time period for which boundary conditions are to be generated. Information on configuring BCON for the different kinds of input data, environment variables, input and output files, compiling and running BCON are provided in the [README.md](../../PREP/bcon/README.md) file in the PREP/bcon folder.

### 4.1.4 Optional Pre-Processor

Insert brief information on JPROC, CALMAP (agdust), and Windblown dust (wbdust).

**>>COMMENT<<** Has anyone run/tested the CALMAP processor recently? Deposition changes in v5.3 have a large impact on dust estimates. Need to think carefully about what we want to say about windblown dust in the updated guide.

**>>COMMENT<<** Are we recommending dust here? How would a user know whether to use dust or not?

**>>COMMENT<<** Figure 2-6: Where do I get these inputs? Need to specify what comes with CCTM and what a user has to do separately. Where does BELD01 come from?

JPROC

Windblown Dust

**CALMAP:** CMAQ has the capability to estimate windblown dust emissions in-line in the CCTM. The CMAQ dust emissions module uses land cover/land use data to identify dust source regions. The dust module includes a feature to estimate dust blown off by the wind (as opposed to anthropogenic dust emissions) from agricultural areas and the impacts of planting and harvesting cycles on available erodible lands that affect dust emissions. Calmap is a preprocessor to the CCTM that uses crop calendar information to produce gridded crop planting and harvesting dates for input to the CMAQ dust module. CALMAP reads grid information from the GRIDCRO2D meteorology file (MCIP output), land cover/land use data from BELD3, and crop calendar data to produce files of planting start dates, planting end dates, and harvesting end dates for different crop types interpolated to the modeling grid. These files are input to the CCTM when it is configured to estimate windblown dust and simulate the impacts of agricultural activity on the windblown dust emissions.

In the WRF-CMAQ two-way coupled model, dust model still works since the equivalent various type of land use fraction in GRIDCRO2D is available from WRF directly.

## 4.2 CMAQ Input Files

[Jump to Table of Input Files](#Input_Table)<br>
[Jump to CCTM Output Files in Chapter 6](CMAQ_UG_ch06_model_outputs.md)

**>>COMMENT<<** Update or remove reference to chapters from old User's document

CMAQ requires a basic set of input files: initial condition file, which is created by ICON process or previous day output; boundary condition file, which is created by BCON process; emission files; and meteorological data created by MCIP using WRF and terrain data. There are a few other input files are required bases on user chosen run time option. CMAQ output files include a basic set of files with aerosol and gas-phase species concentrations, wet and dry deposition estimates, and visibility metrics, and an auxiliary set of output files for diagnosing model performance and in-line-calculated emissions.

Rather than forcing the programmer and program-user to deal with hard-coded file names or hard-coded unit numbers, the I/O API utilizes the concept of logical file names. The modelers can define the logical names as properties of a program, and then at run-time the logical names can be linked to the actual file name using environment variables. For programming purposes, the only limitations are that file names cannot contain blank spaces and must be at most 16 characters long. When a modeler runs a program that uses the I/O API, environment variables must be used to set the values for the program’s logical file names. A complete list of CMAQ input by is provided in [Table 4-1](#Input_Table).

This section describes each of the input files required by the various CMAQ programs. The section begins with a description of the grid definition file, GRIDDESC, which is used by several CMAQ programs, and then goes through a program-by-program listing of the CMAQ input file requirements. [Table 4-1](#Input_Table) lists the source, file type, and temporal and spatial dimensions of each CMAQ input file. The user should consult the CMAQ release notes for additional file information. The programs used to generate the files ("Source") are described in Section 2. Typical time step is 1 hour and user can specify a finer one, e.g. 20 minutes. In addition, typical thickness of a boundary file is 1, i.e. NTHIK = 1 but it can be any positive integer.

<!-- BEGIN COMMENT -->
**>> Comment <<** In Table 8.1, some of the potential sources for the files have not been explained elsewhere (e.g., CSV2NML, Spatial Allocator, Cropcal).

**>> Comment <<** DW: Also I think we should remove everything related to/associated with JPROC and JTABLE since CMAQ does not use it anymore and they are highlighted in the PDF file.

**>> Comment <<** DS: Should the column header by "Environment Variable Namefor File" or "Logical File Name"?

### GRIDDESC: Horizontal domain definition
[Return to Table 4-1](#griddesc_t)

Used by: ICON, BCON, CCTM

The CMAQ grid description file (**GRIDDESC**) is an ASCII file that contains two sections: a horizontal coordinate section, and grid description section.  The GRIDDESC file is generated automatically with MCIP; alternatively, GRIDDESC can be created using a text editor.

The horizontal coordinate section consists of text records that provide the coordinate-system name, the map projection, and descriptive parameters that are relevant to the projection type (e.g. longitude for coordinate system center)

The grid description section consists of text records that indicate the grid name, related coordinate-system name (i.e., which GRIDDESC horizontal coordinate name that is defined in the previous section that is applied to this grid), and descriptive parameters for the coordinates of the lower-left corner of the grid, grid cell size, number of columns, and rows. For a typical CMAQ application, both "dot-point" and "cross-point" grids are defined in the GRIDDESC file; these grids are topological duals in the sense that the vertices (corners) of one correspond to the cell-centers of the other. There are at most 32 coordinate systems and 256 grids listed in one of these files. These files are small enough to be archived easily with a study, and have a sufficiently simple format that new ones can easily be constructed "by hand."

An example of a GRIDDESC file is shown below:

` ' '`
` 'LAM_40N100W'`
` 2 30.0 60.0 -100.0 -100.0 40.0`
` ' '`
` 'M_32_99TUT02'`
` 'LAM_40N100W' 544000.0 -992000.0 32000.0 32000.0 38 38 1`
` ' '`

The horizontal coordinate section (first section) in this example GRIDDESC file defines a horizontal coordinate named “LAM_40N100W”. The coordinate definition is for a Lambert conformal grid, keyed by the first column of the coordinate description line, which corresponds to the numeric code for the various I/O API-supported grid types (2 = Lambert). The next three parameters (P_ALP, P_BET, and P_GAM) have different definitions for different map projections. For Lambert conformal, P_ALP and P_BET are the true latitudes of the projection cone (30°N and 60°N in the example), and P_GAM (100°W in the example) is the central meridian of the projection. The last two parameters, XCENT and YCENT, are the latitude-longitude coordinates of the grid center of the Cartesian coordinate system, which are 100°W and 40°N in the example. If using WRF-ARW as the meteorological model, the user should be aware of differences from this method.

The example grid definition section above describes a grid named “M_32_99TUT02”. The definition of the grid begins with a reference to a coordinate name from the coordinate definition section of the file; in this example, the coordinate named “LAM_40N100W” is referenced in the grid definition. The next two parameters in the grid definition (XORIG and YORIG) are the east-west and north-south offsets from XCENT and YCENT in meters (WRF-ARW usages may differ). The next two parameters (XCELL and YCELL) are the horizontal grid spacing in meters for the X and Y directions (i.e., delta-x and delta-y). The next two parameters (NCOLS and NROWS) are the numbers of grid cells in the X and Y directions. The grid definition concludes with the number of boundary cells, NTHIK, which is typically set to 1.

### {gc|ae|nr|tr}_matrix.nml: Species namelist files
[Return to Table 4-1](#matrix_nml_t)

Used by: BCON, CCTM, ICON, CHEMMECH

Namelist look-up tables for different classes of simulated pollutants are used to define the parameters of different model species during the execution of the CMAQ programs. Gas-phase (gc), aerosol (ae), non-reactive (nr), and tracer (tr) species namelist files contain parameters for the model species that are included in these different classifications. The species namelist files are used to control how the different CMAQ programs and processes handle the model species. The namelist files define the following processes for each model species:


-   Deposition velocity – which (if any) deposition velocity is the deposition velocity for the pollutant mapped to; allowed velocities are specified within the model source code.
-   Deposition velocity factor – if the pollutant is mapped to a deposition velocity, uniformly apply a scaling factor to this velocity.
-   Initial condition– which initial condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   IC Factor – if the pollutant is mapped to an initial condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.
-   Boundary condition – which boundary condition species is the pollutant mapped to; if not specified, this will default to the species name.
-   BC Factor – if the pollutant is mapped to an boundary condition species, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the concentrations.
-   Scavenging - which (if any) species is the pollutant mapped to; Allowed scavenging surrogates are specified within the model source code.
-   Scavenging factor - if the pollutant is mapped to an species for scavenging, uniformly apply a scaling factor to the scavenging rate.
-   Gas-to-aerosol conversion – which (if any) aerosol chemistry species does the gas phase pollutant concentration go into for transformation from the gas-phase to the aerosol-phase.
-   Gas-to-aqueous Surrogate – which (if any) cloud chemistry species does the gas pollutant concentration go into for simulating chemistry within cloud water.
-   Aerosol-to-aqueous Surrogate – which (if any) cloud chemistry species does the aerosol pollutant concentration go into for simulating chemistry within cloud water.
-   Transport – is the pollutant transported by advection and diffusion in the model?
-   Dry deposition – Write the pollutant to the dry deposition output file?
-   Wet deposition – Write the pollutant to the wet deposition output file?
-   Concentration – Write the pollutant to the instantaneous concentration output file?

The namelist files contain header information that describe which class of species are contained in the file, the number of parameters contained in the file, headers describing the parameter fields, and then a series of rows with configuration parameters for every model species. [Table 4-2](#Table4-2) contains the namelist file format for the gas-phase (GC) species namelist file. The namelist files for the other species classifications (AE, NR, TR) are similar to the format shown in [Table 4-2](#Table4-2).

The namelist files for the other pollutant classes have similar configurations as the gas-phase species configuration shown in [Table 4-2](#Table4-2). For an example see this [link](../../CCTM/src/MECHS/cb06r3_ae7_aq/GC_cb6r3_ae7_aq.nml) to the GC namelist species file for the cb06r3_ae7_aq mechanism.

## Initial Condition Inputs
<a id=init_conc_1></a>

### INIT_CONC_1: Initial conditions
[Return to Table 4-1](#init_conc_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

The initial concentrations of each species being modeled must be input to CMAQ. The initial conditions input file type is GRDDED3 and does not vary with time. The actual file data are organized in this manner: by column, by row, by layer, by variable. Initial conditions files have the same structure as concentration files, so the predicted concentrations from the last hour of day 1 can be used to initialize the following day’s simulation. This gives CMAQ users the flexibility to segment simulations in any way they choose.

## Boundary Condition Inputs
<a id=bndy_conc_1></a>

### BNDY_CONC_1: Boundary conditions
[Return to Table 4-1](#bndy_conc_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ boundary condition data are of the BNDARY3 file type. Produced by the boundary condition processor, BCON, CCTM reads these data and correlates them with the interior data by the use of a pointer system. This pointer system designates the beginning location of the data in memory that start a new side of the domain (i.e., south, east, north, or west). Consult IOAPI User Guide for a pictorial description.

Each species being modeled should be in the BNDY_CONC_1 file. If some modeled species are not contained in this file, the boundary condition for these species will default to the value 1 × 10e<sup>-30</sup>. The perimeter of the CMAQ domain is NTHIK cell wide (typically NTHIK = 1), where the number of boundary cells = (2*NROW*NTHIK)+(2*NCOL*NTHIK)+(4*NTHIK*NTHIK).

## Emissions Inputs
<a id=emis_xxx></a>

### EMIS_XXX: Emissions
[Return to Table 4-1](#emis_xxx_t)

Used by: CCTM

CMAQ may accept emissions inputs from a variety of emissions models and preprocessors, as long as the input files created are compatible with IOAPI format. The most commonly used software for preparing emissions inputs is the Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) modeling system, which is a collection of programs that separately process and merge emissions data for each emissions stream for input to air quality models.

The emissions file provides primary pollutant emission rates by model grid cell and time. The file type is GRDDED3, and the units are in moles per second (moles s<sup>-1</sup>) for gas-phase species and grams per second (g s<sup>-1</sup>) for aerosol species. The file data are looped as follows: by column, by row, by layer, by variable, and by input time step. Elevated source emission rates may be provided to CCTM as vertically resolved emissions if the EMIS_XXX file is 3D. The gridded emissions files should be assigned three-digit numeric suffixes to identify them. This suffix is used to link the emission filename to user-defined stream labels and other options (e.g. GR_EMIS_LAB_XXX, GR_EM_DTOVRD_XXX). 

**>> Comment <<** DW: Will these GR_EMIS_LAB_XXX and GR_EM_DTOVRD_XXX be described some where in the user guide?

Starting in CMAQv5.3, users can run with as many gridded emission files as desired, including zero files. Make sure the N_EMIS_GR runtime variable is set to reflect the number of gridded emission files.

## Biogenic and Land Surface Inputs
<a id=ocean_1></a>
### OCEAN_1: Sea salt mask
[Return to Table 4-1](#ocean_1_t)

Used by: CCTM

The CMAQ aerosol models AERO5 and AERO6 can compute sea salt emissions from both open ocean grid cells and surf zone grid cells. The addition of the surf zone option simulates the elevated emissions rates of sea salt in coastal regions where wave action occurs. The OCEAN_1 file contains data on the fraction of each grid cell that is either open ocean (OPEN) or in the surf zone (SURF). When CCTM is compiled with AERO5 or AERO6, it will expect the OCEAN_1 file as input.

The speciation profile file, GSPRO, contains the factors that are used to separate aggregated inventory pollutant emissions totals into emissions of model species in the form required by CMAQ. If only biogenic emissions are being calculated in-line in CMAQ, the GSPRO file used by CCTM needs to contain split factors only for the biogenic VOC emissions that are input in the B3GRD file. If other emissions sources are being calculated by CCTM, VOC split factors for these other sources must be included in the GSPRO file. The GSPRO file format is listed in the SMOKE user’s manual, see: [GSPRO documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/4.0/html/ch08s05s02.html).

Used by: CCTM – inline-emissions version only

The BIOSEASON switch file is an I/O API GRDDED3 file used to indicate which biogenic emissions factor to use on each day in a given year for every grid cell in the modeling domain. This file can be created using the Metscan utility program that is distributed with SMOKE. The BIOSEASON file is time-dependent and usually contains data for an entire year (365 or 366 days). It uses one variable, SEASON, which is either 0 (grid cell should use winter factors for current day) or 1 (grid cell should use summer factors for current day). For additional information about creating the BIOSEASON file, see the [Metscan documentation](https://www.cmascenter.org/smoke/documentation/4.0/html/ch05s03s10.html) in the SMOKE user’s manual.
