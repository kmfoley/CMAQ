CMAQ
====

Community Multiscale Air Quality Model [US EPA Website](https://www.epa.gov/air-research/community-multi-scale-air-quality-cmaq-modeling-system-air-quality-management)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Computational Exposure Division
that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations.
CMAQ is supported by the CMAS Center (http://www.cmascenter.org).

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor
computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone,
particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

### Repository Framework
The CMAQ Git repository is organized with each official public release stored as a branch on the public GitHub USEPA CMAQ repository.
To clone code from the CMAQ Git repository, specify the branch (i.e. version number) and issue the following command from within a working directory on your server. For example, to get the 5.2 version to a local repository that you would name CMAQ_REPO:
```
git clone -b 5.2 https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ.git CMAQ_REPO
```
